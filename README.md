# PowerBi_HR

This project showcases an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize employee attendance data from April to June 2022.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains daily attendance records for employees over a 3-month period. Each row represents an employee's status on a particular date, with key attributes including:

Employee Code and Name
Date of Attendance
Attendance Status:

    * P – Present
    * WFH – Work from Home
    * SL – Sick Leave
    * WO – Weekly Off
    * Other leave types like PL, CL, L

## Dashboard Insights

1. Key Metrics
   + Overall Presence: 91.83%
   + Work From Home (WFH): 10.00%
   + Sick Leave (SL): 1.10%

2.Trends Over Time
+ Presence % by Date:
    + Mostly stays above 90%, with slight drops around mid-May (~78%).
    + Possible reason: holidays, sick leave spikes, or company-wide events.
+ WFH % by Date:
    + Fluctuates, peaking at 23.44% in May.
    + Reflects a hybrid work culture with changing remote work policies or personal needs.
+ SL % by Date:
    + Slight upward trend with small peaks (e.g., 5.12% in June).
    + Indicates specific periods of illness or leave spikes, potentially correlating with external health factors (e.g., flu season).

3.Weekday-wise Patterns
+ Presence:
  + Highest on Wednesday (93.26%) and Tuesday (93.21%)
  + Lowest on Friday (90.19%) — possibly due to long weekend leaves or flexible policies.

+ WFH
  + Most common on Friday (13.01%) and Tuesday (11.51%)
  + Suggests employees prefer remote work around weekends or early in the week.

+ Sick Leave (SL):
  + Slightly higher on Wednesday (1.12%) and Thursday (1.05%)
  + May indicate mid-week fatigue or planned leaves.
  

>>These insights can help identify attendance reliability, work-from-home preferences, and potential support needs.
